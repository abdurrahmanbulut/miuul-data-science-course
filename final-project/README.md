# House Price Prediction Project

## Overview
This repository contains the House Price Prediction project, developed as part of the MIUUL Data Science Program. The project aims to predict hourly prices using data science techniques and is showcased through a web interface built with Flask.

## Project Structure
- `notebook/`: This directory contains the Jupyter notebook where the data analysis and model training are performed.
- `web/`: This directory holds the Flask application that serves the prediction model through a web interface.
- `images/`: Contains images related to the project, including screenshots of the web interface.

## Web Interface
